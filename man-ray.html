            <h4>Man Ray</h4>
            <p>Man Ray (born Emmanuel Radnitzky; August 27, 1890 – November 18, 1976) was an American visual artist who
                spent most of his career in Paris. He was a significant contributor to the Dada and Surrealist
                movements, although his ties to each were informal.

                He was best known for his pioneering photography, and he was a renowned fashion and portrait
                photographer. Man Ray is also noted for his work with photograms, which he called "rayographs" in
                reference to himself.
